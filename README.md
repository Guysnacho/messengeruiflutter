# Flutter Messenger UI

A UI tutorial of the Facebook Messenger UI. Super simple and not very programatic but it definitely taught me some UI tools.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Freecodecamp tutorial I followed](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/flutter-messenger-clone/)

Can run with - ```flutter run```
I ran chose to opt into sound null safety to see if it would change how I went about this tutorial.
